# js_test

**js_test** is a web-based environment to test JavaScript code. JavaScript is a handy and well-made programming language, but the most difficult point to learn it is that you have to set up both a JavaScript and an HTML file to test the code. The HTML file must be prepared so that the result of the JavaScript code is properly shown. If the HTML is not correctly prepared, the JavaScript code cannot be tested, even if the JavaScript code itself is correct.

js_test will change this situation. You don't have to prepare an HTML file to test your JavaScript code. Entering JavaScript code to be tested in the Input window and then hitting the [Run â†“] button immediately give you the result of the code in the Output window. You can test simple single-line code as well as multiple-line code. You can even define one or more functions. The variable placed at the end of the code will be shown in the Output window.
